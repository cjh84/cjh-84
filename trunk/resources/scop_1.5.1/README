SCOP 1.5
========

See the "docs" subdirectory for complete documentation including
reference and tutorial information.

You can create the postscript manual by changing to that directory and
typing "make; make f; make f" (latex has to be run three times to
generate correct references). You can also do "make pdf" to get
a PDF version.

Alternatively, you can grab a ready-made postscript version of the manual
by downloading it from http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~dmi1000/scop

I hope you enjoy SCOP!
