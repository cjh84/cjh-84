This chapter should describe what was actually produced: the programs which were written, the hardware which was built or the theory which was developed. Any design strategies that looked ahead to the testing stage might profitably be referred to (the professional approach again).

Descriptions of programs may include fragments of high-level code but large chunks of code are usually best left to appendices or omitted altogether. Analogous advice applies to circuit diagrams.

Draw attention to the parts of the work which are not your own. Making effective use of powerful tools and pre-existing code is often laudable, and will count to your credit if properly reported.

It should not be necessary to give a day-by-day account of the progress of the work but major milestones may sometimes be highlighted with advantage.
